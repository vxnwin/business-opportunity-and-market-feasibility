#Business Overview

##Our Product
Accourage presents our users with an easy way to connect providers and customers. Our app allows anyone 
looking for a job to be done to match with anyone looking for a job to do. These jobs can be as simple as delivering
food or moving furniture to tasks as complex as fixing a car or renovating a house. Users may then rate their customers
or providers, allowing better match-making ability for future users.
Provide respectful human contact, in person and on the phone.
Make discounts and special offers available for membership.
